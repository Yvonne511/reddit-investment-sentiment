## Project Objectives:

Inspired by GameStop Short Squeeze, our team wants to analyze the ability to use Reddit to predict stock prices. 

**Several questions we might be looking into:**

1. can Reddit predict stock price of all <span style="color:red">industries</span>
2. which <span style="color:red">fluctuations</span> on Reddit indicate a change
3. is there a <span style="color:red">time lapse</span> between Reddit sentiment change and the actual stock price change

## Data Collection:

**There are several metrics we considered for data collection:**

1. which <span style="color:red">subreddit</span> to look into (or the whole platform)
2. how to <span style="color:red">filter</span> relevant comments
